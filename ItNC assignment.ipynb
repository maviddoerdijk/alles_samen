    "# Practical Assigment \n",
    "\n",
    "- Task: Time Series Forecasting on a Synthetic Data Set\n",
    "- Data: please see `train.csv` available on Brightspace\n",
    "- Specifications:\n",
    "  * You are required to implement a **recurrent neural network** in **PyTorch**, which takes as input,\n",
    "  * a recent history of time step $t$, e.g., ... , $t-3$, $t-2$, $t-1$, $t$. \n",
    "  * to predict **five** time step in the future, i.e., $t+1$, $t+2$, $t+3$, $t+4$, $t+5$.\n",
    "  * You can use any recurrent NN models taught from the class.\n",
    "  * You could choose the length of the history fed into the model by yourselves.\n",
    "  * The resulting code structure should contain (1) `model.py` -> the implementation of your own RNN model; (2) `train.py` -> the training code, which can be executed from the command line by `python train.py`; (3) `requirements.txt` that lists the Python packages your are using, including the version information.\n",
    "  * You need to submit your source code and **a dumpy file of the best model you ever trained**. When handing in the assigment, please put `model.py`, `train.py`, `requirements.txt`, and the model dump file in the same folder named by your group and student IDs. The name must be SUBMISSION_<group_name>_<student_IDs> (e.g., SUBMISSION_NC_PA_24_1_s3610233_s3610234_s3610235). Please see [https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/saving_loading_models.html) for a tutorial on how to save/load the model.\n",
    "- **DEADLINE**: June 21, 2024, 12:00. \n",
    "- Please deliver your assignment on Brightspace.\n",
    "- The practical assignment accounts for 30% of the final grade.\n",
    "- When training your RNN model locally on `train.csv`, we suggest to use the [Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)](Mean Absolute Percentage Error) metric to track the performance since we will use this metric to evaluate your model (see below)\n",
    "- Evaluation criteria:\n",
    "  * Your `train.py` should be executable - We will contact you in case a bug is encountered. In this case, you will have one chance to fix it, with a penalty of 1 out of 10.\n",
    "  * We will execute your `train.py` on the training data set `train.csv`, checking against bugs.\n",
    "  * We will load your best saved model and evaluate it on a testing data set hidden to you. \n",
    "  * Any bugs occur in the evaluation phase will incur a penalty of 1 out of 10.\n",
    "  * The evaluation performance - MAPE - on the testing data will be ranked and the top-5 groups will get a bonus of 2 of 10. "

    "Please keep in mind that there are two extra columns indicating the location (`store`) and type (`product`) of the selling event. Please think about how to use those two columns in your model."
